# DoomsDay 

## Basic Details

### Team Name: Darkseid

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Abel S Mathew - College of Engineering Chengannur
- Member 2: Kevin K Mammen - College of Engineering Chengannur

### Project Description
The Doomsday is an apocalypse Counter which is a fun web application that invites users to enter their "Earth name." Once submitted, the app provides a unique experience based on the user's input. The goal is to engage users in a lighthearted way, reflecting on the themes of identity and the end of the world.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
To know how much days have we left in the earth.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We founded a counter which calculates the doomsday for each and every planet in the universe
